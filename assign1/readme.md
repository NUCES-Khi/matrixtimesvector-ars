## Output Screenshots
Uploaded on gcr in csv files
the outputs are being recorded in the csc files however some are uploaded here

[results (1).csv](https://github.com/NUCES-Khi/matrixtimesvector-ars/files/14733342/results.1.csv)
this is a sequentual version

[results.csv](https://github.com/NUCES-Khi/matrixtimesvector-ars/files/14733339/results.csv)
this is a mpi version

[results (2).csv](https://github.com/NUCES-Khi/matrixtimesvector-ars/files/14733325/results.2.csv)
this is an openmp version

[results (3).csv](https://github.com/NUCES-Khi/matrixtimesvector-ars/files/14733333/results.3.csv)
this is an openmp tiled version

[results (4).csv](https://github.com/NUCES-Khi/matrixtimesvector-ars/files/14733336/results.4.csv)
this is a mpi tiled version
 the batch file was not being being uploaded as the github says we dont support that file type 


## Results and Analysis
after the successful execution of the algorithms we concluded that the **openmp** naive version took the **less** time as compared to all the versions.

## Major Problems Encountered
The code encountered issues such as execution failures, processor limitations, complexity, potential infinite output, and failure to generate .csv files.
